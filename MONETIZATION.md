# 💙 Mind Harbor - Ethical Monetization Strategy

## 🚫 What We'll NEVER Do:
- ❌ Display ads (mood-destroying, intrusive)
- ❌ Sell user data (violates trust, privacy)
- ❌ Paywalls for crisis support (unethical, harmful)
- ❌ Limit message counts (creates urgency stress)
- ❌ Show popups during chats (disruptive)

---

## ✅ Ethical Revenue Models:

### 1. **Freemium - Keep Core Free** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Free Forever:**
- Unlimited 1-on-1 chats
- Group chat access

**Premium ($4.99/month):**
- Priority matching (faster connections)
- Favorite listeners (bookmark & request specific people)
- Private journal integration
- Custom themes & avatars
- Voice notes feature
- Chat history export
- Remove "Powered by Mind Harbor" badge

**Why This Works:**
- Core mission stays free
- Vulnerable users never blocked

### 2. **"Buy Us a Coffee" Donations** ☕
**Voluntary Support:**
- "Support Mind Harbor" button on homepage
- One-time donations: $3, $5, $10, custom
- Monthly supporters get badge: "💙 Harbor Supporter"

**Implementation:**
- Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, or Patreon
