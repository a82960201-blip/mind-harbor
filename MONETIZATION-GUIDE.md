## 💙 The Cheryl Standard:
**"Would Cheryl want this?"**

Before any monetization decision, ask:
1. Does this help more people get support?
2. Does this maintain dignity and privacy?
3. Would I want this if I were in crisis?
4. Does this honor the mission?

If the answer to ANY is "no", don't do it.
